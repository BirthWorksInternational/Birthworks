However, I have had very little response from her and the past few times that I tried to reach her, she was on a break from the computer (literally) and did not answer or reply to my calls. She said she wanted to finish and that she had  some recordings done and I asked her to send them. That was the last of our actual (successful) communication.
5/10/12 I left a message on her machine a week+ ago and mailed past due extension reminder today -sw

I think she may not like me (I know, quite unbelievable... :) ) - she was using this crazy lady's blog as a source regarding risks of homebirth and we had some communication related to the credibility of that blog. That was the last I heard from her... She has a bout half of the books completed, but that's all and has not responded to my last emails...

mia book program completed 10/15/2012

owes $390 (11/5email sent) Sandy is waiting for reply

9/17/13 - Nicol had been contacted by sandy who requested payment of balance (in addition to previous payments which were made recently and were supposedly final) however Nicol was very upset as she believes that she has already overpaid. It seems to be the case that this is correct although her initial lump sum payment that she made is not recorded anywhere in quick books (it is highly likely that a check was cashed my mia or some similar nonsense).-
In light of these facts it has been decided that Nicol's balance will be set to zero, she does NOT owe us any money and should not be contacted for further payments regardless of what our records show. (9/17 -sw as per Cathy Daub)

Transferred from Reviewer Rapine to Daub 12/7/15.

update from CD: 3/28/13:I spoke with Millicent this afternoon.  She is going to be ordering books from our online store.  She has been preoccupied with a job that finishes in June and then will begin working on our program.  I know there is an extension required.  Furthermore, she wants to host a CEW and maybe a DEW in her area next year.  I talked to her about engrade- she doesn't know how to use it so I told her to call into the office on Wednesday when you are both here. sw

I had a family death, and then because of that my Mum developed heart problems and it has been a terrible year . I'm sorry I have let you down with not completing in time. But I really want to finish the course and be the best Doula in Taraunga:). Now I have my family settled I can focus on my course 100%. I have emailed Birthworks about their annual.""

Fee and my extension. And I can't get onto the Website for some reason. Could I arrange to call someone and pay by Credit Card on Monday. Please don't cancel my enrolment , I promise to make up for lost time and be one of your best Doulas ever:). Look forward to chatting soon:). Sorry for letting you down and having to apply for an extension .Hope you are all well. A friend of my Carlee has put her name down for your Doula course next year and she's excited. And when she's trained we are going to work together. Happy Day :)
